# Saad’s Accord (one-page mods site)

## What this is
A simple, fast, dark one-page website with:
- A header (title + bio)
- A grid of mod cards (image + video title + mod name)
- Each card opens a link in a new tab
- Social icons (replace links later)

## Edit your mods
Open `mods.js` and replace the example items:
- `image`: put your image file in `/assets` and set the path like `assets/mod-01.jpg`
- `videoTitle`: your mod video title
- `modName`: the mod name
- `link`: the product link

## Add your images
Put your images in the `assets/` folder.
Recommended:
- JPG or PNG
- 1200px wide (or more)
- Keep names simple: `mod-01.jpg`, `mod-02.jpg`, ...
